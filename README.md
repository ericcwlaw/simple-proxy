# Simple TCP socket proxy

This proxy was originally designed to allow a user to ssh into a Ubuntu multipass VM from the host machine or the Internet.

I am amazed about the simplicity and performance of the proxy, thus polishing it to become a generic socket proxy that you can use to do network address translation (NAT) from a host port to a guest VM target IP and port.

## proxy-config.json

The IP discovery command, source and target ports are configurable using a JSON file like this. You may adjust the configuration file to fit your use case.

```json
{
  "discovery": {
    "command": "multipass exec main ifconfig eth0",
    "tag": "inet",
    "index": 1
  },
  "source_port": [22],
  "target_port": [22],
  "authorized": ["192.168.1.*"]
}
```

If you want the proxy to detect hyper-v VM in Windows directly, you can replace proxy-config.json with proxy-config-hyperv.json.

There are two sample proxy config JSON files:

1. proxy-config-multipass.json
2. proxy-config-hyperv.json

You can adjust the config file to fit your use case.

## SSH security

If you use this to expose your guest VM to the Internet, make sure you use certificate authentication and disable password authentication. You should also use SSH certificate of 4,096 bits for security reason.

If you are using Multipass, you can replace the original SSH certificate with a 4,096-bit certificate.

## Running this utility as a service

We recommend that you use Node's PM2 process manager to deploy the utility as a service.

It is as simple as:

```
pm2 start simple-proxy.js
```
This assumes you start the utility from the project directory. If not, please add path to the filename.

## Library dependencies

Please install the moment time utility before you start the utility.

```
cd simple-proxy
npm install
```

## Port-Forward utility

A convenient port-forward utility is derived from the simple-proxy app.
This port-forward utility is particularly useful when using VMs in your laptop.
It allows you to reach the VM's applications (docker/kubernetes, etc.) from the host OS.

The port-forward utility is a command line tool. You can run it like this:

```
node port-forward.js source_ip:port target_ip:port
```
To listen to all IP addresses of the host, you may use 0.0.0.0 as the source_ip


## Idle disconnect timer

The system has an idle disconnect timeout value of 30 minutes, you may adjust it according to your use cases.
